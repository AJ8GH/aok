<ul>
<li><code><</code> to move the arm from <code>A</code> (its initial position) to <code>0</code>.</li>
<li><code>A</code> to push the <code>0</code> button.</li>
<li><code>^A</code> to move the arm to the <code>2</code> button and push it.</li>
<li><code>>^^A</code> to move the arm to the <code>9</code> button and push it.</li>
<li><code>vvvA</code> to move the arm to the <code>A</code> button and push it.</li>

<p>In total, there are three shortest possible sequences of button presses on this directional keypad that would cause the robot to type <code>029A</code>: <code><A^A>^^AvvvA</code>, <code><A^A^>^AvvvA</code>, and <code><A^A^^>AvvvA</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the area containing this directional keypad remote control is currently experiencing high levels of radiation and nobody can go near it. A robot needs to be sent instead.</p>
<p>When the robot arrives at the directional keypad, its robot arm is pointed at the <code>A</code> button in the upper right corner. After that, a second, different directional keypad remote control is used to control this robot (in the same way as the first robot, except that this one is typing on a directional keypad instead of a numeric keypad).</p>
<p>There are multiple shortest possible sequences of directional keypad button presses that would cause this robot to tell the first robot to type <code>029A</code> on the door. One such sequence is <code>v<<A>>^A<A>AvA<^AA>A<vAAA>^A</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the area containing this second directional keypad remote control is currently <code>-40</code> degrees! Another robot will need to be sent to type on that directional keypad, too.</p>
<p>There are many shortest possible sequences of directional keypad button presses that would cause this robot to tell the second robot to tell the first robot to eventually type <code>029A</code> on the door. One such sequence is <code><vA<AA>>^AvAA<^A>A<v<A>>^AvA^A<vA>^A<v<A>^A>AAvA^A<v<A>A>^AAAvA<^A>A</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the area containing this third directional keypad remote control is currently full of Historians, so no robots can find a clear path there. Instead, you will have to type this sequence yourself.</p>
<p>Were you to choose this sequence of button presses, here are all of the buttons that would be pressed on your directional keypad, the two robots' directional keypads, and the numeric keypad:</p>
<vA<AA>>^AvAA<^A>A<v<A>>^AvA^A<vA>^A<v<A>^A>AAvA^A<v<A>A>^AAAvA<^A>A
v<<A>>^A<A>AvA<^AA>A<vAAA>^A
<A^A>^^AvvvA
029A
